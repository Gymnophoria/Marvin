I mean, it's pretty simple. It's a bot on discord. Has quite a few features, perhaps It'll have a website or wiki in the future. Who knows?

If you aren't familiar with Discord, it is a free voice and text chat for gamers, much like Skype or Teamspeak. Although Discord actually looks good, and has plenty of features.

Now, on said Discord, I made a bot, Marvin. This is because I saw other bots, and thought <i>Hey, I want one of those!</i>
I decided to go on an adventure with very little coding experience. Ran Windows on my Mac to get a C# bot.. Didn't like it.
Ruby? Still no clue what I was doing. Perhaps lua? Of course not. But Discord.js? I guess that was the one.
I mean, at the beginning, I was still just copying code with no idea what it meant. Yet over time, I learned how to properly code a bot, and I can't say I'm dissapointed with the result. Yay me!

So here I am, guy who slightly understands javascript with a pretty cool bot. Dunno.
If you'd like, you are free to <strike>kill my internet</strike> [have the bot](http://bit.ly/invitemarvin) join your server.

For help, do `.help`.

I actively develop the bot as much as I can. If you'd like to see new features and you have a cool idea, or just want to talk, feel free to DM me on Discord at `Gymnohporia#8146`, or [join the bot's server](http://discord.me/marvin).

G'Day/night/afternoon/mornin' to ya!

Gymno.

Note: You do <i>not</i> have my permission to reuse my code with your token to run your bot, however you are free to use my code as reference for help with coding a bot.
